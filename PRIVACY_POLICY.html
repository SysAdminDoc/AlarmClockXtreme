    <h1>AlarmClockXtreme Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective date: February 21, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>AlarmClockXtreme is an open-source alarm clock application. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This app does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with anyone, including the developer.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>AlarmClockXtreme does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No analytics or tracking SDKs are included</li>
        <li>No advertising frameworks are included</li>
        <li>No personal data is transmitted to any server</li>
        <li>No user accounts or registration are required</li>
        <li>No crash reports are sent automatically (crash logs are stored locally on your device only)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following permissions, all used locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Exact Alarms (SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM)</strong> &mdash; Required to fire alarms at the exact time you set</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS)</strong> &mdash; To show alarm alerts and the persistent next-alarm notification</li>
        <li><strong>Foreground Service</strong> &mdash; To play alarm sounds and vibration reliably</li>
        <li><strong>Boot Completed</strong> &mdash; To reschedule your alarms after device restart</li>
        <li><strong>Wake Lock</strong> &mdash; To keep the screen on while an alarm is firing</li>
        <li><strong>Location (ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)</strong> &mdash; Optional. Used only to fetch weather for your area from the Open-Meteo API. Your coordinates are sent directly to Open-Meteo's server and are not stored or transmitted anywhere else. You can use the manual location feature instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar (READ_CALENDAR)</strong> &mdash; Optional. Used only to display today's events on the dashboard. Calendar data is read locally and never transmitted.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrate</strong> &mdash; To vibrate the device when an alarm fires</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Network Requests</h2>
    <p>The app makes the following network requests, all to free, open-source APIs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo Weather API</strong> (api.open-meteo.com) &mdash; Fetches current weather and forecast. Only your latitude/longitude is sent. No API key or authentication required.</li>
        <li><strong>Open-Meteo Geocoding API</strong> (geocoding-api.open-meteo.com) &mdash; Converts city names to coordinates when you manually set a location. Only the search query is sent.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No other network requests are made. The app functions fully offline except for weather data.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Alarms, settings, and alarm history are stored in a local SQLite database</li>
        <li>Preferences are stored in Android DataStore (local encrypted storage)</li>
        <li>Backup/restore exports data as a JSON file to a location you choose</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The only external service used is the Open-Meteo weather API, which is free, open-source, and does not require authentication.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>This app does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app does not collect information from anyone.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
